Building Open Data
==================

#### Open Data v1
* Angular
* Gulp
* Big Single Page Application
* Unit tests on file change
* Backbone resulted in lots of boilerplate

#### Client Defined API
* JSON:API
* Swagger for documentation
* Client asks for exactly what they want

#### V2 Considerations
* Trade-offs
* What is the framework optimized for
* Ember can build ambitious web apps, very opinionated, added more code for the framework, but then required less lines of code to build a simple todo app then backbone and others
* Components all the things
* Ember Addons
* Ember deprecation notices
* Ember uses Glimmer
* Fast-Boot a.k.a Server Rendered Apps
* Varnihsh as an HTTP Caching mechanism
* Cards and Card Editing concepts
* Ability to create custom dashboards
* Features are pluggable as Ember Addons
* Shared themes and Themeable Apps that pull theme information and branding by building sass on the server and sending back css
* Calcite Bootstrap
* Embeddable via scripts

* Cedar for charting, it tells Vega (sitting on d3) how to talk to feature services
